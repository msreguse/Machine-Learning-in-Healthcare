# Machine Learning in Healthcare

## Project Overview
This serves as a tutorial on how to apply machine learning for regression and classification applications using healthcare data.
This project comprises of two tasks.
**Task 1**
This task involves the estimation of length of stay using a subset of MIMIC III data.
The derived subset is *task1.csv*
This is a regression problem
**Task 2**
This task involves the prediction of hospital readmission for diabetic patients.
The data used is derived from *Diabetes 130-US hospitals for years 1999-2008 Data Set*
The derived subset is *task2.csv*
This is a classification problem

## Environment Setup
Refer ***ML_tutorial.pdf*** to set up the environment for this tutorial.

## Code
The notebook : ***ML_tutorial.ipynb*** contains all the code.
